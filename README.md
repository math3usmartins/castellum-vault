# Castellum Vault Manager

Castellum Vault Manager is a free & open source library to manage digital
secrets, made for those who are tired of commercial solutions that fail in their
mission to keep digital secrets safe.

This is not a tool ready to be used, this is a building block, but it can be
used for building secret management tools.

## Free & open-source

We -- authors and contributors of all kind -- believe everyone should be able
to keep their digital secrets safe. Even if they can't pay for it, even if they
are able to pay, and even if they are commercial companies. They should have an
option to use a tool which is free and open source to keep their digital secrets
safe. In the end, it's about people's privacy and safety. And that's our
ultimate goal anyway.

## Friendly yet type-safe

It's written in TypeScript to be more friendly for most developers in the world,
despite their focus in backend or frontend or mobile apps.

Also, it's written in TypeScript because we believe type-safe code is an easy
step to have safe code. We understand other languages could provide even more
safe code and/or better performance, but TypeScript provides the best pros/cons
balance for our needs.

## Flexible

As it's written in Typescript, which converts to Javascript, it can run in a
browser as well as in a server -- and we believe such flexibility is essential
to reach more people, developers and users.
